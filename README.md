# HAP_CO2mineralization
Concerting AIMD and Machine Learning workflow to study artificially accelerated mineralization (AAM-CO2) of CO2 on nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite or amorphous hydroxyapatite or their hybrids, further constructing a strategic framework of Ca-O-P-H nanomaterial configurations for CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
